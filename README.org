#+TITLE: My Personal Website

This website is being generated with [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][hakyll]]. A choice which is quite
obvious if you know me... yes, Haskell. The template being used here 
was made by me with CSS and html. It works well enough on mobile and 
larger screens and although some might call it simple I call it good 
enough. The whole website project has suffered a lot of changes trough 
out the past years (it started in 2021 according to the commit 
history). If you want to laugh at my previous attempts of making a 
reasonable website go ahead, I do that a lot of times.
