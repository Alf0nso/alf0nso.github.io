#+TITLE: My Personal Website

This website is being generated with [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][hakyll]]. A choice which is quite
obvious if you know me... yes, Haskell. The template used on the 
website was made by me with CSS and html. It works well enough on 
mobile and larger screens. Although it still has some problems, I will 
keep improving it. The whole website project has suffered a lot of 
changes trough out the past years (it started in 2021 according to the 
commit history). If you want to laugh at my previous attempts of making 
a reasonable website go ahead, I do that a lot of times.

The image above is a very interestingly shaped stapler. More than 
enjoying it's form I believe it sort of represents well the purpose of 
this website. I am trying to make this repository a compilation of 
information about me and my thoughts stapled together in one place.
