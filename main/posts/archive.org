I really enjoy to write and share the things I create. This space is
intended for that! Right now is quite empty... Writing takes time and I
procrastinate a lot... But with time I hope I will be able to obligate
myself to write down my thoughts, ideas and discoveries... I hope...

** Things I am part of
I tend to join myself into too many projects, currently besides my
normal day job I am:

- Staff/admin and member of [[https://devpt.co/][DevPT]]
- Member of [[https://rggd.gitlab.io/members.html][RUGGED]]
- member of a cooperative called Ax√≥nio (currently under development)
