Not that my life has anything out of the ordinary, but if curiosity
brought you to this website then I might as well give you some
information about me. The dithered image present on this page is me.
More specifically me on 18 of May of 2024. I tend to change the
way I present myself quite a lot so if right now I do not look like
that, don't be surprised. The image here was transformed using the error-diffusion algorithm Floyd–Steinberg.

** Academic
I attended [[https://colegiodestomas.com/en/][Colégio de S.Tomás]] from 1st year of school to the last day
of High School. During this period I took 3 Internships (two related to
biology and one to engineering). Although my initially intention was to
study biology, I decided to go for Geospatial/Geomatics engineering at
the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. Close to the end
of my third year of university, I went to the Netherlands for an
Internship at the [[https://www.itc.nl/#][ITC]], where I also helped with some practical classes.
After being back from Enschede, I got another Internship at a company
called [[https://www.thinkfuture.pt/][Think Future]]. Before concluding my bachelor’s, I was already
certain on the idea of pursuing a master’s degree. However, I was
unsure between studying Geodesy or Computer Science. Although I still
maintain a fascination for the representation and measurement of the
physical shape of the earth, I did choose to pursue CS in order to
study Programming Languages, Compilers and Quantum Computing.

** Music
Music is definitely what I can call "my hobby". It started casually
with learning an instrument for fun and evolved into a couple of bands
and musical endeavours. I could easily dedicate multiple paragraphs to
each project, but that would be more of an article, which this is not.
For this reason, I mention here that I played the guitar on the song
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBZZrDuIRKo][Nothing Concrete]] by Why Knot. Played the drums and sang on
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghCJIslON8Q][The Spoon Of The Gods]] by Pod Pop and I was the Drummer of a band called
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XqsTF8x76Y][Azma]]. I also played guitar live with the [[https://www.instagram.com/splitobjects/][Split Objects]]. It should also
be mentioned that I was a student (for 4 years) on the
[[https://pt.idruma.com/][International Drum Academy]] where I attended classes with [[https://www.michael-lauren.com/][Michael Lauren]].
