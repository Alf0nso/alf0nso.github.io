On the Internet, I am generally known as Grasshopper, or “Gafanhoto” in
Portuguese. I am currently roaming around the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula][Iberian Peninsula]],
mainly between Lisbon and Madrid. Also I might or might not be currently
procrastinating some life obligations I should have already dealt with.
Currently looking for a job, I like to work with compilers and
functional languages.
