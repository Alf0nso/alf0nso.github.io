- Have been trying to help with bugs in flang ([[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/134986][issue]])

- Played and Finished the main game of Outer Wilds, it's amazing!

_Thoughts:_

A lot of time has passed since the last *now/* update, (a year). This is
largely due to my need of chaining dependencies for any simple
task. When I add a line to this page saying I *finished* a book, for
example, my head always drifts to the idea of also having a separate
linked post with the photograph of the book's cover and a paragraph
expressing my feeling towards the work. Finding the ideal photograph,
re-sizing it, choosing a good format, dithering/or not, writing my
thoughts, editing what I wrote, and many other tasks, suddenly
materializes on top of "writing a single line saying I finished
reading a book". The concept has a name: [[https://xo.tc/what-is-yak-shaving.html][yak shaving]], and it is indeed
sort of a huge problem in my life... For *now/* I am setting the goal of
avoiding this behaviour at all costs by accepting that anything I
write here can be edited, improved upon or extended later!
