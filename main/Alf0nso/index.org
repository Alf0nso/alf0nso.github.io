Upsi... At some point in time this path was pointing to the main page 
of the site. Not anymore! To make a long story short, I did not 
know one could make a github repository publish the web pages with 
"alf0nso.github.io" as root. Thanks to [[https://bernzrdo.wtf/][bernzrdo.wtf]] now I know, (aka [[https://twitter.com/espamamapixa][Microsoft OfficeÂ® PowerPoint]] on twitter). If you want to go to the website's main page you just have to click on the little grasshopper.
