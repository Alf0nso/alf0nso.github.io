<p>Not that my life has anything out of the ordinary, but if curiosity
brought you to this website then I might as well give you some
information about me. The dithered image present on this page is me.
More specifically me on 15 of November of 2022. I tend to change the
way I present myself quite a lot so if right now I do not look like
that, don’t be surprised. The image here was transformed using the a
specific error-diffusion algorithm called Floyd–Steinberg.</p>
<h2 id="academic">Academic</h2>
<p>I attended <a href="https://colegiodestomas.com/en/">Colégio de S.Tomás</a> from 1st year of school to the last day
of High School. During this period I took 3 Internships (two related to
biology and one to engineering). Although my initially intention was to
study biology, I decided to go for Geospatial/Geomatics engineering at
the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. Close to the end
of my third year of university, I went to the Netherlands for an
Internship at the <a href="https://www.itc.nl/#">ITC</a>, where I also helped with some practical classes.
After being back from Enschede, I got another Internship at a company
called <a href="https://www.thinkfuture.pt/">Think Future</a>. Before concluding my bachelor’s, I was already
certain on the idea of pursuing a master’s degree. However, I was
unsure between studying Geodesy or Computer Science. Although I still
maintain a fascination for the representation and measurement of the
physical shape of the earth, I did choose to pursue CS in order to
study Programming Languages, Compilers and Quantum Computing.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Music is definitely what I can call “my hobby”. It started casually
with learning an instrument for fun and evolved into a couple of bands
and musical endeavours. I could easily dedicate multiple paragraphs to
each project, but that would be more of an article, which this is not.
For this reason, I mention here that I played the guitar on the song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBZZrDuIRKo">Nothing Concrete</a> by Why Knot. Played the drums and sang on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghCJIslON8Q">The Spoon Of The Gods</a> by Pod Pop and I was the Drummer of a band called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XqsTF8x76Y">Azma</a>. I also played guitar live with the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/splitobjects/">Split Objects</a>. It should also
be mentioned that I was a student (for 4 years) on the
<a href="https://pt.idruma.com/">International Drum Academy</a> where I attended classes with <a href="https://www.michael-lauren.com/">Michael Lauren</a>.</p>
